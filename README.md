# M8tro Bootstrap Theme

*This is work in progress*

A Bootstrap theme inspired by Windows [Modern UI](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/dn465800.aspx) (aka “Metro”). The default font is from the [Segoe UI](http://www.microsoft.com/typography/fonts/family.aspx?FID=331) family, which should already be installed on Windows Vista and later. On iOS and Android, the respective default fonts will be used as substitute.

## Usage

### End user

Download a copy of [m8tro.min.css](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/idleberg/m8tro-bootstrap/master/dist/m8tro.min.css) and use it in place of a Bootstrap 3.1.1 (or compatible) style-sheet. It is [not advised](http://stackoverflow.com/a/5503156/1329116) to embed a link to the raw file hosted on GitHub, since it increases load time.

This theme can be used with [Bootstrap Listr](https://github.com/idleberg/Bootstrap-Listr).
