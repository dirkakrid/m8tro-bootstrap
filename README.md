# M8tro Bootstrap Theme

*This is work in progress*

A Bootstrap theme inspired by Windows [Modern UI](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/dn465800.aspx) (aka “Metro”). The default font is from the [Segoe UI](http://www.microsoft.com/typography/fonts/family.aspx?FID=331) family, which should already be installed on Windows Vista and later. On iOS and Android, the respective default fonts will be used as substitute.
